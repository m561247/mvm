# bench/

Cross-language microbenchmark scripts.
The numbers feed [mvm.sh/bench](https://mvm.sh/bench) via `bench.json`.

## Workloads

- **fib35** -- recursive `fib(35)`, exercises function-call dispatch.
- **sieve** -- Eratosthenes sieve, N=10,000,000, exercises tight loops
  and array writes.

Each workload has one source file per runtime (`fib35.{go,py,lua}`,
`sieve.{go,py,lua}`).

## Reproducing locally

```
# install hyperfine if needed
make bench
```

The Makefile target builds `mvm`, runs each workload under
`mvm`, `lua5.4`, `lua5.1`, and `python3` via [hyperfine][hf], writes
`bench/bench.json`, and refreshes the `<!-- bench:start -->` block in
the repo's top-level README.

`bench.json` is a one-shot snapshot, not a time series.
Hardware varies a lot, so the numbers in the committed JSON reflect the
machine that last ran `make bench` (recorded in the `cpu` /
`platform` fields).
Re-run on your own machine for an apples-to-apples comparison.
